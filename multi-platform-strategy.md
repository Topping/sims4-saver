### Multi-Platform Strategy for Sims4-Saver (Windows & MacOS)

#### 1. Core Application Logic

*   **Python Compatibility:** Ensure all Python code is platform-agnostic. Avoid Windows-specific API calls or libraries. Use `os.name` or `sys.platform` for conditional logic where necessary.
*   **Path Handling:** Use `pathlib` module for all file path operations to ensure cross-platform compatibility (e.g., `/` vs `\\`).

#### 2. Process Monitoring

*   **Cross-Platform Library:** Investigate and integrate a Python library for process monitoring that supports both Windows and macOS. `psutil` is a strong candidate, offering functionalities like listing processes, getting process details, and terminating processes.
*   **Platform-Specific Implementations:** If a single library cannot cover all required functionalities, abstract the process monitoring logic and implement platform-specific modules (e.g., `process_monitor_windows.py`, `process_monitor_macos.py`) that are called based on the detected operating system.

#### 3. Tray Icon (System Tray / Menubar)

*   **GUI Framework:** Choose a GUI framework that offers robust cross-platform system tray icon support.
    *   **`pystray`:** A good option for creating system tray icons with menus on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    *   **`rumps` (macOS specific):** If more advanced macOS menubar features are required, `rumps` could be used in conjunction with a Windows-specific solution.
*   **Icon Formats:** Ensure icon files are in formats compatible with both operating systems (e.g., `.png` for general use, `.ico` for Windows, `.icns` for macOS). Implement logic to load the correct icon based on the OS.

#### 4. Application Icons

*   **Build Process:** Update the build process (likely using PyInstaller, given the existing `.spec` file) to generate macOS application bundles (`.app`) with the correct icon resources.
*   **Icon Files:** Provide high-resolution icon files in `.icns` format for macOS and `.ico` for Windows.

#### 5. User Interface (if applicable)

*   **GUI Framework:** If the application has a user interface beyond the tray icon, select a cross-platform GUI framework like `PyQt`, `Kivy`, or `Tkinter`. `PyQt` is generally preferred for desktop applications due to its comprehensive features and native look and feel.

#### 6. Build and Packaging

*   **PyInstaller:** Continue using PyInstaller but adapt the `.spec` file to support macOS targets. This will involve defining different `datas` (for icons, localization files) and potentially different `hiddenimports` or `pathex` depending on macOS-specific dependencies.
*   **Testing:** Establish a robust testing pipeline that includes building and testing the application on both Windows and macOS to catch platform-specific bugs early.

#### 7. Localization

*   **Consistent Approach:** Ensure the existing `localization.py` approach is flexible enough to handle differences in language display or resource loading between platforms, if any.

#### 8. Dependencies

*   **Cross-Platform Libraries:** Prioritize libraries that are known to work well across platforms. Review current `requirements.txt` and `uv.lock` for any Windows-specific dependencies.
*   **Dependency Management:** `uv` is already in use, which is good for consistent dependency management.

This strategy will enable the Sims4-Saver application to transition to a multi-platform environment while maintaining its core functionality and user experience.
